# Vehicle Parking System

## Overview
This project implements a simple vehicle parking system where users can add, remove, search for vehicles (cars and bikes), and calculate revenue based on parking duration. It's a command-line application written in C.

## Features
- **Add vehicle**: Users can add cars and bikes to the parking lot by providing their plate numbers and parking duration.
- **Remove vehicle**: Users can remove a parked vehicle by entering its plate number.
- **Search vehicle**: Users can search for a vehicle by its plate number.
- **Calculate revenue**: The system calculates revenue based on the parking duration of each vehicle.
- **Plate number validation**: Plate numbers are validated to ensure they follow a specific format (i.e. KA19MG1234).

## Requirements
- This program requires a C compiler to build and run.
- The code is platform-independent and should work on any system with a C compiler installed.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the main.c file.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the system.
